    <h1>Welcome to My Guitar Hobby</h1>
    <p>Guitar has been a huge passion of mine for years. I love playing, collecting, and teaching others.</p>

    <p>I primarily play an Eastman guitar (acoustic electric) and regularly 
        play at weddings, and live music at restaurants.
        the guitar is an instrument of endless possibilities. 
        From classic rock to jazz, I enjoy exploring different styles.</p>
